Analysis of Aerial Images to Detect Solar Panels 

The structure of this repository is as follows...

1. The 'Data sets' folder contains the training, testing and for NRW also the validation images, from two locations (the states North-Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and California in the U.S.).
2. The folder 'Data_sets_creation-code' includes the code used to download, pre-process and compile the images used to the data sets.
3. The folder 'Models' comprises the application and fine-tuning of four CNNs originally created for the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challange to the task of classifying solar panels.
4. The 'evaluation code' folder includes the code that was used to evaluate the models and also apply the best model to the benchmark data set (with the images from California).
