in the vision prep files several techniques are tested for identidying roofs in the pictures
The most successfull approach is using the edge density in different subsquares of the picutres
removing green color range also helps in the task. dark green and light yellow overlap with roofs color hence can't be removed
The img splitter file recursively splits an image in multiple subimages removing the ones with not enough edges 

The second approach was using YOLO object recognition networks in https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2
This approach was left after realizing that a proper labeling of bounding boxes has to be done and that this model requires too many resources to train

The third approach is to use computer vision standard object recognition techniques. These are preferred as in out situation
the perspective and angle is always the same.
The cyvlfeat library is used to obtain sift descriptors for each image, different window sizes were tested
The obtained descriptors for all images are later on clustered with kmeans in what will be the final features used for classification.
The images are later analyzed and described by the amount of features present from each cluster (histogram)

This approach was tested for both roof and solar panel recognition, scoring a 90% accuracy on the first and a 60% on the second
This approach still needs some parameters to be tuned, these will be soon tested.

Now seeing if a combination on the first and secon approach can bring to better results.

Built a simple labeling GUI to label the so obtained roof pictures (usually 75x75). It processes all files in a folder called roofs and allows manual labeling of them one by one moving them in pos/neg folder.

Build 2 simple convolutional models for solar panel recognition. Tested them with and without data augmentation. The used data is the once hand labeled about aachen.
The accuracy of the bigger model with data augmentation is about 97%
